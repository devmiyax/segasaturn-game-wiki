# Sega Saturn Game Documentation Project

## 📖 Project Overview

It has been more than 30 years since the Sega Saturn was released. With its large-capacity CD-ROM storage and high-performance graphics chip, it was the first home console to make 3D gaming practical. Many masterpieces were born from its innovative features. However, as time passes, the memories of these great games are gradually fading away.

This project aims to document Sega Saturn games to preserve them for future generations. We will record and share game overviews, gameplay guides, strategies, hidden tricks, and memorable scenes to ensure the legacy of Sega Saturn lives on.
